# Path-Rating

Path Rating is a project that is built for the purpose of helping mostly people with disabilities but also tourists that don't know which path should they choose to reach their destination.
The rating of the path can be marked based on the following factors:
* Accesibility
* Security
* Traffic 
* Helping means for people with disabilities (ramps,stairs)

The user creates a path in the circle in his map and rates any path he creates. He can see the distance (in meters) of all paths he has created till now and also delete any path he wants.
Then, he submits the total data into the database and his results come into a leaderboard that shows the overall rating in meters.
In the leaderboard there can be seen the user with the most rated paths together with the metered results.
